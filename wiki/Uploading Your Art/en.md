### Important Notes
- Always check your file meets the **supported file types** and **size limits**. See [File Types](./File%20Types) for details.
- Use accurate **tags** to make your content discoverable. See [Tagging](./Tagging) for guidance.
- Posts with inappropriate content or incorrectly marked ratings may be removed or hidden per our [Content Rules](./Content%20Rules).  
  We'll always reach out to you to let you know if your post has been removed, and what action you can take to fix it. Unless you're acting maliciously on purpose, you won't get banned :)
- You can edit your post after uploading to fix typos, add tags, or change visibility.
