# Tagging
## How to Tag Your Posts

Tags help people find your content. On Anthera, tags are:

- **Lowercase**
- **Letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores only**
- **No spaces** (spaces are converted automatically to dashes)

### Guidelines
- Use tags that describe your post clearly (characters, themes, style, etc.)
- Avoid overly generic tags like `art` or `photo`, these wonâ€™t help people find your work
- Add multiple tags if your post fits several categories
- Tags are searchable and used in filters and blacklists, so pick meaningful ones to help people discover or appropriately filter your content.

### Examples
| Post Type                    | Suggested Tags                      |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| silly protogen in blender    | `cute`, `protogen`, `3d`, `blender` |
| painting of a (feral) dragon | `dragon`, `painting`, `feral`       |
| photo of a cool fursuit      | `fursuit`                           |

Sometimes, using fewer tags can be better, but make sure to always include one or two!
