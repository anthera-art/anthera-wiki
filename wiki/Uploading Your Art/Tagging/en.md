# Tagging

## How to Tag Your Posts

Tags help people find your content. On Anthera, tags are:

- **Lowercase**
- **Letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores only**
- **No spaces** (spaces are converted automatically to dashes)

### Guidelines

- Use tags that describe your post clearly (characters, themes, style, etc.)
- Avoid overly generic tags like `art` or `photo`, these won’t help people find your work
- Add multiple tags if your post fits several categories
- Tags are searchable and used in filters and blacklists, so pick meaningful ones to help people discover or
  appropriately filter your content.

### Examples

| Post Type                             | Suggested Tags                             |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| silly protogen in blender             | `cute`, `protogen`, `3d`, `blender`        |
| painting of a (feral) dragon          | `dragon`, `painting`, `feral`              |
| photo of a cool fursuit               | `fursuit`, `suit`, `photo`                 |
| digital art of two characters hugging | `friends`, `hug`, `digital-art`            |
| pixel art animation of a fox          | `fox`, `pixel-art`, `animation`, `video`   |
| landscape with glowing crystals       | `landscape`, `fantasy`, `crystals`, `glow` |
| icon commission for someone’s sona    | `icon`, `commission`, `sona`               |

Sometimes, using fewer tags can be better, but make sure to always include one or two!

Make sure to also include any tags that might describe specific kinks within the image, e.g.
