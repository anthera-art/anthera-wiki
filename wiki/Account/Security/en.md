# Security
## Keeping Your Anthera Account Safe

Anthera account security is handled through your **UNTONE Account**. All sensitive settings, like passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA), are managed there. You can access your UNTONE account settings at [https://untone.org/account](https://untone.org/account).

### Passwords & Authentication
- **Password Resets:** Handled entirely through UNTONE. If you forget your password, visit the <a href="https://untone.org/pw-reset">UNTONE Account Password Reset</a> page.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Strongly recommended. You can enable it via your UNTONE Account at any time.

---

### Account Recovery
Since Anthera accounts are linked to UNTONE, all recovery options (forgotten password, lost 2FA device) are handled through UNTONE.
- If you need support with your UNTONE Account: **contact `support@untone.uk`**
