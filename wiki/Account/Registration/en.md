## Creating an Anthera Account

Anthera accounts are tied to an **UNTONE Account**, our own external OAuth service. All account management, including password resets, two-factor authentication, and security settings, happens there.

### Step 1: Connect UNTONE
1. Click the "*Log In or Create An Account*" button in the top right, or visit <a href="/login">the login page.</a>
2. Sign in to an existing UNTONE Account or create a new one.
3. Accept the OAuth connection to allow Anthera to link your UNTONE Account.

Once connected, you’ll be prompted to choose your **Anthera account handle**, which is your public and unique username on the site. You can change this any time!

### Step 2: First Setup Wizard
After creating your Anthera account, you’ll go through the **First Setup**, split into three main steps:

#### **Step 1: Profile**
- Edit your **username** and **handle**.
- Upload a **profile picture** (pfp) and **banner**.

#### **Step 2: Privacy & Age**
- Set your **date of birth**.
- Configure visibility for different content ratings:
  - Safe
  - Suggestive
  - Mature
  - Explicit

Keep in mind that if you are under 18, you will not be able to view or upload Mature or Explicit posts.

#### **Step 3: UI Theme**
- Choose your preferred **UI colour theme**.

#### **Step 4: Done**
- You’re ready to explore Anthera!
