# About Anthera
## Who We Are

Well, I'll start with who *I* am:

I'm Tanza! I'm the developer and creator of Anthera. I've been working on the site since 2022 and to this day am the only person working on the technical side of things (please help), but we also have plenty of people helping out on moderation as well!

We're a part of UNTONE, which is just a group of a few people, notably me and Retiu (Guus Heber), who is running a record label within UNTONE. We're not a company or anything, it's just a fun name we get to brand things we make under :)

I started working on Anthera due to my dislike of self-moderation and the moderation in general on Certain Other Furry Sites, but that's really just an excuse; I more so just wanted a cool project to work on!


### What Anthera Is

Anthera is a community for the entire furry fandom, from artists and writers to other furries who just like to explore and enjoy content. It's a place to share your art, discover new creators, and interact with some cool people!

We're always working on new features, such as right now we're working towards Video and Audio uploads, and you can view our <a href="/roadmap">Roadmap</a> if you're interested in learning more about what's to come!
