### Can I do commissions through Anthera?
Of course! Just make sure to tag your post accordingly.

### Can I post commissioned art on Anthera?
Only if the commissioner allows it, always read their terms and guidelines on what you can do with their art! If you can upload it here, please make sure to add them as an artist on the item by using the "Authors" system.

### Is non-furry art allowed on Anthera?
Of course! Our site is primarily catered towards furry art, but we allow all types of art and photos, as long as they follow the rules!

### Can I tag other users in a post?
Yes! You can tag people in a post description to credit them or reference them by using `@username`.

### Why was my post hidden or removed?
Posts can be hidden if they are rated incorrectly or violate content rules. Repeated violations may lead to account penalties.

### Can I post mature or explicit (NSFW) content?
Yes, as long as you follow the content rating rules and mark it correctly. Under 18s cannot view mature or explicit content.

### How do I report content?
If you see something against the rules or inappropriate, email **support@anthera.art** with a link to the post and any context. We are working on an on-site report feature as well.

### How does the art shown on the homepage get chosen?
Homepage art is picked from a pool of catered art that we thought was cool enough to show off on the homepage! If you're not happy with your art being here, please let us know.

### Will my drafts always exist?
We try to keep them around as long as possible, but sometimes large-scale maintenance or reworks of internal app code can mean that we'll have to remove them.

### What do I do if there's a "System Error"
We're immediately alerted of any errors that occur whilst you're using the site, so it's best to leave and try again in a day or two! Please contact us through email or the Discord server us if issues persist.
