# How to Help
## Ways You Can Contribute to Anthera

Want to help out with Anthera? That's awesome! Here are a few ways you can contribute:

### Spread the Word
Share Anthera with others! More links in more places means more visibility, which brings in more cool people. Our goal is to build a fun and welcoming community for furry artists.

### Report Bugs
If you find bugs or unexpected behavior on the site, please report them. The best place to do this is via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/anthera-art/issues) or in the **bugs** channel on Discord.

### Help Write the Wiki
The wiki is still pretty empty. If you see a page that could use content, or if you want to write a new article about a feature or aspect of the site, feel free to make a pull request at [GitHub](https://github.com/anthera-art/anthera-wiki). (Localization isn’t live yet, so no need to worry about translations for now.)

### Help Develop the Site
If you’re comfortable with JavaScript or PHP—or both!—and want to contribute to development, let us know. The site is currently closed source, but open sourcing is planned in the future. In the meantime, you can chat with me to get access to the repo.
