# Rules

## Key Rules
- **AI-generated content**
  - Images that include *any* AI-generated parts (“AI art”) are prohibited across the entire site.
  - Text that is partially generated by AI must be clearly labeled in the tags, title, and cover (if applicable). Fully AI-generated written works such as stories, poems, and similar content are strictly not allowed.
  - Exceptions may be made for educational or informative posts that clearly mark AI-generated content in the title and tags. These are reviewed case-by-case by moderators.

<br>

- **Minor characters in mature/explicit content**
  - Mature or explicit sexual content involving minors is strictly prohibited.
  - A character is considered a minor if their *canon* age is below the age of majority, or if they show multiple traits associated with a juvenile appearance. Height does not count toward this.

<br>

- **Ratings and tags**
  - You must correctly label your uploads with the proper tags and rating.
  - If unsure which rating to use, feel free to contact us any time - if you don't feel like contacting us, just pick the higher limit of what you think is correct - we'll let you know if you can turn it down. Please read [Tagging](/wiki/Uploading%20Your%20Art/Tagging) for more information.

<br>

- **Spam and Advertising**
  - You may advertise your YCH, but only once. Do not delete and re-upload your post as an attempt to gain more traction/visibility. Posting about open commissions is also okay. Do keep in mind we have a planned feature to be able to add commissions, etc. directly to your profile.
  - Do not post any spam advertisements other than what is specified as allowed in these rules. We'll never ban for this unless you spam them particularly hard.

<br>

- **Other Rules**
  - When uploading art from other artists, do NOT remove their signature. Keep in mind you can still only upload art that either you have made or you have commissioned from another artist, if you have no involvement at all you can not upload it.


<br>

Moderators may edit posts that can be fixed through editing, or delete posts that cannot.  
If your post is removed or edited, you’ll receive a notification explaining why.  
Repeated violations, especially involving content warnings or prohibited material, may result in account suspension or a permanent ban.

## Crediting
- You may **not upload art you don’t have permission to upload.**
- If you have permission to upload someone else’s work, you must credit the artist using the **Authors** feature.

## Art (including animations and other digital works)
- Tags are optional but strongly recommended for better discovery.
- Non-sexual nudity must be rated **Mature**.
- Nudity with sexual implications must be rated **Explicit**.
- Nudity must never appear under **Safe** or **Suggestive** ratings.
- Sexually suggestive art without nudity should be rated **Suggestive** or **Mature**, depending on severity.

**Reminder:** “NSFW” means *not safe for work*.  
If an artwork might get someone in trouble in a polite setting, it does not belong in the **Safe** category.  
The **Suggestive** rating is for art that is neither fully mature nor completely safe.

Anthera is for users aged 13 and up.  
Any content with nudity or highly suggestive themes must always be rated **Mature** or **Explicit**.  
Only users aged 18+ can view or upload to these categories.

Videos are currently intended for **animations** and fall under these same rules.  
Videos featuring **real-life people or subjects** are not allowed at this time (this may be revised later).

## Photos (including real-life videos)
- Any photographic or real-world material that would be illegal in the **EU** or **UK** is strictly prohibited.
- Content depicting **gore, abuse, child abuse, animal abuse**, or similar material is not allowed.  
  Users who upload this type of content will face immediate action.
- **Sexual or NSFW photographic material** is currently not allowed and will be removed.  
  This rule may change in the future.
- Videos of real-life content is not currently permitted and will be taken down. This rule will likely be changed in the future so keep an eye on this page if you're looking to upload some videos.


## Video Specific:
Videos are mainly intended for animatiosn and artwork, as such more "content"-like videos (such as game playthroughs, vrchat sessions, etc) are currently not permitted. 

Small memes are probably fine but we'll handle these on a case-by-case basis (or as i once wrote in a code comment long ago, a base-by-base casis) :3
