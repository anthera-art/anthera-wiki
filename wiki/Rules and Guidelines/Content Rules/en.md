# Content Rules
## What you can and can't post on Anthera

<small>Last updated 21 Aug 2024</small><br>
This document covers what types of art and work you can and can't post on Anthera, along with how to properly tag and add disclaimers to your posts.

# Categories

Anthera has three categories you can upload your art into. Please make sure you upload to the right ones. Moderators may move art that has been uploaded into the incorrect category.

- <h3>Art</h3>This is where any digital or traditionally made art goes. Most things that don't fit into the other categories would go here.
- <h3>Photo</h3>This is where photographs of real things go, for example pictures of crafts, fursuits, landscapes, etc.
- <h3>Text</h3>This category is for any kind of text post. This includes stories, poetry, or non-fiction prose.

Reminder: Please make sure to read through the rules of what is allowed in each category. These can be found further down the page.

# Rules

### Key rules
- Images where any part has been generated by AI image generators (often called "AI art") are prohibited across the entire website. Text that has been partially or fully generated by AI must be labelled as such in the tags, title, and cover (if applicable). 
  - If the image includes AI art for educational or informative reasons, and is very clearly marked as such with tags and in the title, it may be allowed. Moderators will judge this on a per-case basis.
- Mature or explicit sexual content containing characters who are minors is strictly prohibited.
  - Characters are judged to be minors if they have a "canon" age that is below the age of majority, and/or if they contain multiple "immature" traits that contribute to a juvenile appearance. Height is not a factor in this.
- You must correctly add content labels and ratings pertaining to the content uploaded. If you are unsure, please ask a moderator.

Moderators will manually edit posts in the cases that can be rectified by doing so, or delete them if they break the rules in a way that can't be solved by editing the post data, and a message/notification telling you what you did wrong will be sent to your account. If you repeatedly break the rules concerning content warnings, or upload prohibited content to the website, then action will be taken against your account and you may be banned.

### Crediting
- You cannot upload art for which you have not gotten direct permission from the creator to upload.
- When uploading art that is not yours with permission, make sure to credit the artist through the Authors feature.


### Category / Art
- Tags are not required, but are strongly recommended for art discovery.
- Non-sexual nudity should be marked as mature, nudity with any sexual implications should be marked as explicit.
- Nudity should never be in safe or suggestive sections.
- Sexually suggestive art without any nudity, depending on the severity, should be marked as either suggestive or mature.

Remember, "NSFW" means "not safe for work". If a piece of artwork would be liable to get someone in trouble for looking at it in a polite setting, then it most likely doesn't fit in the "safe" rating. We have a "suggestive" rating for artwork that is neither mature nor safe for that reason.

Always keep in mind that this site is made for all age groups 13 and up, so any content with any sort of nudity or overly-suggestive content should always be placed in the Mature or Explicit rating. Users need to be 18+ to view and upload to these rating categories.

### Category / Photo
- Any photographic material that would be illegal in the EU or UK is not allowed on the site.
- Photographic images containing gore, abuse, child abuse, animal abuse, and other such content are strictly prohibited. Action will be taken against users who upload this sort of content.
- Images containing *any* sexual or NSFW content are currently not allowed and will be removed, for the time being. We may change this rule in the future.
