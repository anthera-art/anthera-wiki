# Community Guidelines
## What you can, and can't do across Anthera

This document covers all areas of Anthera, such as Comments, Post Descriptions, User Bios, and more.

# Global Rules
These rules apply to everywhere on the site.

- Targeted harassment of individual users or specific groups is prohibited. This includes releasing personal information without consent.
- Do not discuss mature or explicit topics outside of items marked as mature or explicit. We'll have an NSFW profile type soon as an option for users who want to discuss such topics on their profiles.
- Descrimination based on gender, sexual orientation, race, or any other personal characteristics belonging to an individual or a group of users is prohibited.
- Please be respectful to your fellow users. We want to build a creative and constructive community on this site.
- Public accusations of rulebreaking is counterproductive and only draws negative attention. If you have concerns about another user's behaviour, please report it or contact a moderator directly.
- Please don't bring unrelated topics into discussions without justification. This means you shouldn't use someone else's post as a platform to share your own opinions. It disrupts the flow of conversation, and it goes against the spirit of the site, its community, and its rules.
- Please do not spam. This includes making multiple posts with the same image, creating walls of repetitive text to draw attention, posting copypastas in the comments, or (similar to the previous rule) repeatedly trying to bring up unrelated topics in comments sections.
- Depicting the symbols of hate groups, or expressing affiliation with hate groups, is prohibited. An exception can be made for informative pieces of art describing hate groups (like what they have done, the harm they cause, or how to recognise them) or pieces that clearly do not express sympathy or allegiance with them. As a rule of thumb, a hate group is one that promotes any discrimination that is already banned on this site, including historical groups or parties. This is a tricky issue that is ultimately up to moderator discretion. If you are unsure if the art you want to upload is okay, please ask a moderator.
# Account Rules
- Your Profile Picture and User Banner must not have any explicit or NSFW content within it, as it is currently not possible to hide these from underaged users.
- Your name and bio cannot be sexually or violently explicit.
- You must not impersonate other people using your username and handle. Roleplaying as popular characters is allowed, but stealing the identities or characters of specific users is not. This will be handled on a per-case basis.
