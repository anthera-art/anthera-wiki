# Moderation
## Keeping Anthera Safe and Friendly

Anthera is a small community, but we want it to be safe and enjoyable for everyone. Our moderation team helps ensure posts, comments, and other content follow the rules.

For more details, check the specific pages:
- [Reporting](./Reporting)
- Also see the Rules and Guidelines pages!

## How we handle posts that break the rules

- **Accidental mistakes**: If a user marks content incorrectly by accident, we'll reach out to help them correct it and make the post public again.
- **Clear guideline violations**: We remove the content and warn the user. Illegal content may result in an immediate ban.
- **Intentional/malicious actions**: Repeated or clearly malicious violations can result in a ban, including repeated violations of the above items.

Our general approach is to try to help wherever we can and avoid the "nuclear option" (banning) whenever possible.

## How we handle rude comments

If a comment is inappropriate, we remove it and explain why. Continued bad behavior may result in a ban or removal of commenting privileges.

## How to appeal

If you feel a moderation action was unfair, email us at `contact@anthera.art`.

Something to keep in mind: we're a brand new platform with a new team and, admittedly, have basically zero past experience with community moderation. We're trying our best!

If you have any concernsâ€”about moderation, content on the site, or anything else, please *please* reach out! You can email us at `contact@anthera.art` or join our Discord server linked in the footer.
