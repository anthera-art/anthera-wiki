# Reporting
## How to Report Content

If you see content on Anthera that seems inappropriate, harmful, or in violation of the rules, you can report it to our moderation team.

In case you're unsure about if something *does* break the rules, or if you're unsure about how to rate or tag your own art, feel free to email as well!

### How to contact us
- Send an email to **support@anthera.art**.
- Include:
  - A link to the post or comment
  - The reason you believe it violates the rules
  - Any additional context that might help moderators

### What now?
- Our moderators will review your report and take action if necessary.
- Actions may include hiding content or contacting the user.
- Repeated or serious violations may result in content removal or account penalties.


We are planning to add an on-site report feature soon, but for now, you'll just have to deal with emailing me :)
